*Warning*: Use my configuration at your own risk!

* About this config

Neovim is a refactor, and sometimes redactor, in the tradition of Vim (which itself derives from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stevie_%28text_editor%29][Stevie]]). It is not a rewrite but a continuation and extension of Vim.

Official Website:
- [[https://neovim.io/]]

* Setup

Requires Neovim (>=0.5)

There are ways on how to configure neovim but this repo is entirely configured and written in [[https://www.lua.org/][lua]]. If you want to start learning from scratch try to clone this repo it is also written in lua before trying my configuration, make sure neovim is not installed on your machine.

#+begin_src sh

 git clone https://github.com/LunarVim/Neovim-from-scratch.git ~/.config/nvim

#+end_src
